Machine Learning
 1.Supervised ML
 2.Unsupervised ML

 1. Supervised ML (labeled data)
 input >> Output >> Training >>> Model
 model >> prediction
     1.Classification
     2.Regression

 Classification >>> to predict a categorical data
      categorical data >> yes/no, True/False, 1/0, category
      eg,:weather prediction, Iris dataset>> predict species of Iris flower, disease diagnosis, market value profit/loss
 Regression >> to predict a numerical data
     eg:- predict interest rate based on credit score, predict amount of rain, predict change % in market value

 classification algorithms
  >> Naive Bayes
  >> Decision Tree
  >> Random Forest
  >> Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  >> K-Nearest Neighbours

 Regression algorithms
  >> Simple Linear Regression
  >> Multiple Linear Regression
  >> Polynomial Regression

 2.Unsupervised ML (unlabeled data)
 Input Datas >>> generate o/p and perform supervised learning
    Clustering alg
        >> K-means
    Clustering mainly used in market segmentation
     ie, giving offer to customers who buy different types of clothes, jewellery

Machine Learning Steps
    1. Data Collection
    2. Data Preparation and Exploration
    3. Model Creation
    4. Performance Evaluation
    5. Model Improvements and deployments

 1. Data Collection
    *kaggle,github
 2. Data Preparation and Exploration
    ie, feature extraction/selection >> extracting only required columns
    Data Exploration >> visualization
